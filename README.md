## Description

This Jupyter Notebook analyzes the standardized test results of reading and math comprehension for an entire school district, to help determine future budget and educational policy priorities.

This exploratory data analysis focuses on reading and writing scores, seeing how the passing rates work compare with a variety of metrics. It summarizes district-wide results, then breaks down the data per each school in the district. It locates the highest performing and bottom performing schools. It summarizes math and reading scores per grade level per school. It breaks down passing rates based upon school spending per student, and categorizes those values to easily disply the impact of school spending per student upon test scores. It does the same for the size of the school (based upon total number of students). Finally, it looks at the passing rates based upon the type of school (charter vs. district).

Results are summarized at the top.

## Usage
